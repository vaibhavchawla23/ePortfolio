            <h2>Launching into Cyber Security</h2>
            </br>
            <details>
            <summary><b>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 - Summary Post:</b></summary>
            <p align="justify">The day-to-day relevance of the topic encouraged the discussion to cover a broad spectrum of variables. Our discussion ascended 5 key reasons emphasizing the cardinal need to address Cyber Security as matter of urgency and invest in Cyber Security globally. </br>
              <p align="justify"><b>1.   The exponential increase in endpoints with the advent of IoT over 5G. </b></br>
               5G brings a range of benefits with its ability to support a massive number of static and mobile IoT devices, which have a diverse range of speed (Internet of things in the 5G era Opportunities and Benefits for Enterprises and Consumers, 2019).5G with the internet of things (IoT) will undeniably introduce the alarming number of devices online and thus making the networks via these end devices even more vulnerable for Cyberattack (Miller,2021).
               <p align="justify"><b>2.   Endless avenues to apply IoT and their sensitivities. </b></br>
               The focus is now shifting towards remote or industrial control context-aware autonomous solutions using the technologies like Machine-to-machine, or M2M and Internet of things, or IoT (Chawla, 2021).</br>
               Freya aptly draws our attention towards the role IoT can play in the medical discipline with a real-life example of spinal surgeries performed on twelve patients over China Telecomâ€™s 5G network. Effectively pointing out at the sensitivity of the things at stake if network hosting these devices and services are compromised (Basey,2021).</br>
               <p align="justify"><b>3.   Implementational challenges. </b></br>
               I concur with Arun on the unspoken issues of integration and interworking with legacy protocols (Arunanthy,2021). These legacy protocols are not encrypted and carry all the information in plain text. </br>
               These sophisticated algorithms running over M2M and AI need constant interfacing with the device endpoints and need to be updated over the air, or OTA. The legacy telecommunications standards do not cover secure implementation of these protocols and associated upgrades procedures (Chawla, 2021).</br>
               <p align="justify"><b>4.   Regulatory Compliance and decentralization of collected data.</b></br>
               Rachel emphasizes the need for regulatory compliancy of the Tech Giants to ensure multiple layers of protection against cyber-attacks to protect the collected personal and sensitive data from the consumer endpoint devices. (Murerwa,2021)
               <p align="justify"><b>5.   Stricter vendor selection criterias.</b></br>
               Kin highlights that this expected surge in data and bandwidth over distributed network, demands even more hardware and stricter vendor selection criteria (Wong,2021). This argument urges the us to learn from past experiences with Chinese vendors and impels us to revaluate our vendor selection strategy.</br>

            <summary><b>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2 - Summary Post:</b></summary>
            <p>This specific collaborative learning discussion has not only pushed all the participants to go beyond the generic comprehension of cybersecurity but also urged all to reflect on the technologies at various levels using real-life examples. The initial posts highlighted two of the most widely accepted technologies Virtual Desktop Infrastructure and Stateful Fuzzing Frameworks. Having said that the width of information from this exercise requires us to categorize the security technologies into 3 wide realms of approaches. </p>
            <p><b>1. Physical and human factor driven approaches:</b><br> This category covers the technologies that have direct interaction with humans along with the social engineering aspects. It presses the importance of rightful access solely for the intended personnel on the very physical level. (e.g., accessing a data centre) using technologies like biometric scanners, RFIDs, as rightly pointed out in the forum by Kin. (Wong et al., 2021). </p>
            <p><b>2. System and Network driven approaches:</b><br> The system-level factor covers the hardware-based security technologies like Trusted Platform Module (TPM) enable the IT administrators to ensure the confidentiality of the commissioned systems throughout their life cycle (Luvaha et al., 2021). It also considers the security of the networks to which these systems might connect. The networks are designed based on the traffic models which help to choose the best type of firewall depending on the applications running at the endpoints. Simon concurred by acknowledging that the above complications can be somewhat bypassed by implementing VDI (Miller et al.,2021).</p>
            <p><b>3. Solution design driven approaches:</b><br> This type of factors encompasses the integration of technological solutions like the use of zero trust tokens-based authentication, multifactor authentication. Use of secure protocols like TLS while integrating with third-party solutions like DNS, etc (Khan U et al.,2021). Employing Stateful fuzzing frameworks to test the boundary conditions of these secure protocols (Miller et al.,2021). Designing a solution with an open scope to be able to provision and integrate with upcoming technologies like artificial intelligent firewall (Diez R. et al.,2021).</p>

                           The algorithms enabling this technologies require real-life datasets to be trained and improved. Hence, the collection data from the endpoint devices and secure storage scope needs to be well articulated in the regulations to refrain the tech giants to gain any sort of autonomy.
                           The increase endpoints and traffic demands more infrastructure. Recent miscreance from the Chinese vendors, urges us to revisit our vendor selections procedure and conventions.

         <h2>Network and Information Security Management</h2>
         </br>
         <summary><b>Module Summary</b></summary>
         </p>
         <h4>Preface</h4>
          <p align="justify">The Network and Information Security Management coursework covers a great breadth of information to develop a cybersecurity professional's critical thought process. Our cohort was divided into groups, enabling us to collaborate and witness vivid perspectives. I was in Group 2.
            Group activities start with a case study, "Compromising a Medical Mannequin", to establish the importance of cybersecurity while drawing attention towards the sensitivity of the things at stake in the real world. The seminar gave all a chance to understand the operational layers and dynamics that come into play from designing to delivery of any product. Considerable interdependence with old established systems with no planned updates or maintenance follow-ups makes the medical industry one of the most fragile targets. This revelation fuelled our interest to understand and discuss the design choices and mitigation plans.
            The module gave us a broader perspective covering various aspects and helped us classify the scope into four main categories: technical, organisational, procedural, and legal. The subsequent units helped us develop a more in-depth understanding of each of the above categories.
         </p>
         <h4>Technical</h4>
         <p align="justify">
            Hosting the website gave us a first-hand experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform and the various services offered. The services we worked with were EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, S3 and IAM (Identity and Access Management). The granularity of IAM helped in imagining the scale at which large scale organisations operate. 
            Kali Linux is a free, well-regarded, and widely accepted Debian based vulnerability assessment and penetration testing distribution. It encloses more than 500 utilities, is used by all the experts in the cybersecurity industry. It proved to be an ideal sandbox to try our hands-on industry's sophisticated testing suites like Metasploit, Nikto and OpenVas.
            The reading lists and seminar gave us an overview of the TCP and OSI model, which helped us build a robust foundation for data networking concepts and ethical hacking. While performing reconnaissance, we used various tools and utilities to understand AWS network topology. The methodical approach helped us perform a thorough analysis of applications hosted on the website with Linux version, firmware version, kernel level, which helped us find the exploitable Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).

         <h4>Organisational</h4>
         <p align="justify">
            The proposal writing helped us develop a critical thought process to plan, analyse, and contest the best methodologies for e-commerce websites. The exercise required us to draft a proposal that chooses one methodology over another with a strong supporting rationale. We developed a 360Â° understanding of the information flow through an organisation. Communicating the information like project plan in terms of time, lifecycle, and methodologies is vital. It gives the company/organisation firm ground to evaluate the scope and align their expectations. 
            Writing the executive summary helped us realise the overlapping scope of different departments might have and the importance of communicating the relevant information to the right level more effectively. The summary gave us a glimpse of a real-world ecosystem where technical accuracy is one of the many variables of the equation. The hierarchical structure in an organisation bestows different responsibilities at different levels. Hence accuracy, relevance and clear expectations are essential components of any executive summary. 
         </p>
         <h4>Legal</h4>
         <p align="justify">
            With the help of the case studies, we were able to put the learnings to the test. In the case study, I highlighted two essential boundary conditions that a system could encounter while enforcing General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) across political boundaries. The case study helped understand boundary conditions included:
            -	Maintaining two independent opt-out queues as part of the UK and the EU. The opt-out requests were being updated only in one of the two queues.
            -	GDPR requires collective responsibility across overlapping business units to design and devise methodologies that see through the system's implementation while respecting the political boundaries.
            Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) and its 12-point requirements enforce procedures to secure the transactions done via payment cards. It covers a wide array of potential security risks from physical to logical application-level security to avoid data theft and data breach. 
            Both GPDR and PCI-DSS deal with data security and have considerable overlap. However, the characteristic differences are the use cases for which they were conceptualised. We could comfortably say that GDPR regulates to ensure individual control over personal data by including the detailed clauses. On the other hand, PCI ensures security and minimize data retention on the point of sales and online transactions to secure the card payment industry. The standards are not impediments rather guidelines to help us be ready for the rainy-day scenarios.
         </p>
         <h4>Procedural</h4>
         <p align="justify">
            The latter units of the module helped us develop an in-depth understanding of logging and digital forensics in cybersecurity. In case of any data breach or any planned attack, logging and forensics serve as a pillar to analyse the impact and make a firm case if/when taken to court. The need for a breach plan and (Plan, Do, Check, Act) PDCA checklists play a vital role in recovering the system and mitigating impact and hence are inculcated in respectable ISO standards. 
         <h4>Teamwork</h4>
         <p align="justify">
            Our Team, Group 2 was very supportive, and all the members believed in shared ownership. All the members proactively followed up on the WhatsApp group, where we convened for casual chats and updated each other on the progress. We met twice every week on Skype to discuss the reading lists, brainstorm on the tasks at hand and collaborate. We shuffled tasks with some basic knowledge transfer to ensure everyone gets a chance to contribute. We took some time to have informal sessions to share experiences and give each other day to day examples to improve understanding.

        <h4>Evaluation of Final Project (Unit 11) vs. Design Proposal (Unit 6)</h4>
        <p align="justify">
           The issues with AWS for getting the web-site up and running derailed the focused considerably. It was only after an open dicussion on zoom and constructive <a href="files/DDocFeedback.jpg"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>feedback</i></a> received for the design document, we understood the expecations. The assignment was intended to develop critical thought process to plan, analyse, contest the methodologies that fit best for e-commerce website. It required us to draft a proposal that elects one methodology over others with strong supporting rationale. The requirement was propose a holstic plan to the executives with high level details like engagement, dependencies, strategies and timelines need to the performing the audit and not the audit itself.
           Based on the above inputs, the team ensured executive summary included criticality of the methodologies used. Reflecting on the requirements and expectations we should focus on evaluating the business and compliance implcations instead of the vulerabilities themselves.
           <br>
           <br>
           Hence, in the executive summary we went an extra mile to connect all the dots to make a complete document that touches the below aspects:<br>
           - Seamlessly corelated with design document.<br>
           - Compare and explain GDPR and PCI-DSS.<br>
           - Evaluate the vulerabilities from technical, business and compliance point of view.<br>
           - Conclude with actionable items imcluding mitigation plans and recommendations.<br>

         Research Methods and Professional Practice</br>
         <h3>Relective Summary</h3>
         <section>
            <h4>Preface</h4>
            <p align="justify">I clubbed another module along with Research Methods and Professional Practice, which indeed tested my time management skills. Nevertheless, I was able to keep up with the respective deadlines. This module runs through twelve units, where every unit focuses on distinct notions and questions that any academic scholar would stumble upon during the course of their research. Looking back this module has certainly equipped us with various philosophies to develop the requisite robust and unbiased stance to commence any research.</p>
            <h4>UNITS 1-3</h4>
            <p align="justify">
              The first unit encourages the development of a critical thought process needed to conduct scientific research by giving numerous examples. It explains different types of reasoning and inferences along with the respective settings they can be used in. The collaborative case study allowed us to investigate the ethical implications of deploying unmanned technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning. The exercise also urged us to analyse the butterfly effect of unmonitored algorithms that can develop unforeseeable bias by the manipulation of inputs. The active participation in the discussions helped me reflect on the vivid point of views and appreciate the ethical responsibilities we carry in the computing vocation. Unit two and three fostered the importance of literature review to identify an exhaustive research problem, then funnelling the problem to focus on a definite research question. The reading lists stimulated the development of conceptual models that underscored the importance of good research questions while contemplating the difference between open and closed questions (Pennink, Jonker and Pennink, Bartjan W, 2022). I came to realise that, only a thorough literature review can translate into succinct questions or sub-questions with justifiable criteria, which aids simplification of selection of research methodologies. Deconstruction of the research problem into requirements plays a crucial role in navigating throughout the research process. Likewise, it is vital to distinguish the scientific and practical requirements to determine their applicability in the proposed situations.            </p>
            <h4>Units 4-6</h4>
            <p align="justify">
              The chosen case study focused on studying the cybersecurity posture of the current waste management system served as a good reference to develop a much-required outlook to assimilate the intricacies with the help of observations and engagement groups. It not only advised us to choose our focus areas while designing the questionnaire but also required us to take into consideration the comfort, consent, and privacy of the participants. The wide reading list covered a broad catalogue of data collection methods and reinforced the necessity of planned analysis required to synthesise a mature all-inclusive point of view. A well-thought feedback loop by means of surveys and questionnaires responded to by focused groups and relevant audience helps us garner insights into the categorical specificities. The following units stressed the analysis of surveys and interviews and the ways to utilize them efficiently in the investigations. The cohort included students from different inclinations which considerably enhanced the diversity of questions and discussions in the seminars.            </p>
            <h4>Units 7-9</h4>
            <p align="justify">
              The summative assignment gave a conducive sandbox to build upon our grasp and put the learnings to test. Instantaneously, the critical yet encouraging feedback from Prof.Stefania helped me stitch together my hands-on industry experience and the academic criticality cultured in the module. Her rich professional experience and commitment to improving our understanding were evident in all the 1-1 meetings. The meetings played an important role in scaling the module and give me the needed sense of depth to pursue the upcoming capstone project for the masterâ€™s degree. The exercise required us to draft a proposal that elects methodologies with strong supporting rationale by critically challenge the survey methods.  Unit seven focused on ensuring validity and reliability by taking design choices in terms of measurement scales, variables, and intervals to pre-define the direction of research assessment methods. On other hand, one could argue against this predetermination of variables could create bias, while favouring dynamicity, flexibility to supporting the scalability of the research scope. The workshops in the following units gave an overarching understanding of statistical analysis and its need in the research studies. The formative assignments gave a first-hand view of interpreting and extracting usable information from statistics and datasets. The probability analysis with the preliminary sample datasets allows us to determine the likelihood of the outcome. The exercises highlighted the key concepts of statistical inference that are desirable to draw conclusions and hypothesis testing to assess the credibility of the visualized models (Bhatia, 2018).</p>
            <h4>Units 10-12</h4>
            <p align="justify">
              The last units touch upon the administrative aspects of research work in a thought-provoking way. Any research project/thesis/dissertation involves the logical flow of academic arguments that drives beyond the purpose to touch the enveloping implications the research might have. The tutorâ€™s candour and the reading lists encouraged me to pause and ponder the outlines including trivial aspects of the dissertation module straightaway. In retrospection, this module taught me there is no substitute for planning, preparation, persistence, and professionalism to approach any project. My professional experience requires me to deliver as an individual contributor, but the latter units helped me envisage a broad orchestral view of large-scale projects while buttressing the importance of finance, time, and resource management. It encouraged me to appreciate the correlation between risks, uncertainties, constraints, and viability before taking up any risk assessment, impact analysis or mitigation strategies.
              <h4>Key takeaways & Conclusion</h4>
              <p align="justify">
                There are some of the key takeaways that will transcend this module and even academic settings per se are take time to equip oneself to traverse the breadth of identified area of interest. To form an unprejudiced thought process, it is essential to read conference papers, journals, articles and critique every literature you come across. Employ the SMART framework to disintegrate the research into finer sustainable and reliable goals.<br>

                The module developed a stout momentum after choosing the literature review topic focusing on the introduction of cybersecurity in existing waste management systems of ever-growing urban cities. The meetings with the tutor served as a vital platform to better comprehend their feedback and constructive guidance to stress the details consistent with the academic expectations. The exercises played an instrumental role in pushing us out of our comfortable subjects and building a durable understanding of existing research. Identifying the gaps and critical evaluation literature allowed us to develop a concise yet strong research question. The research question acts as the guiding north should be used to realign periodically. It facilitates development of a logical justification for choosing apt research methodologies for the proposal. In retrospection, this module has certainly equipped us with abundant philosophies to develop the requisite, robust and unbiased stance to commence any research.
