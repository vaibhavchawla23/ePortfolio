About me: 
I'm a seasoned technical professional with hands-on experience in Telecommunications and Data Networking Industry while being associated with ICT giants like Ericsson & Mavenir Systems.
I have a demonstrated track record across all the phases of technical project delivery from solution designing, integration of IMS and ETSI-NFV to Test case designing for Customer Go-Live sign off.
I am an assertive "Go Getter" and strong believer in the notion of “learning by doing”.
Inspired by DIKW Pyramid, I love indulging in cross domain meet-ups to gain more information and hence increase knowledge.
I am an audiophile with an innate urge to sense the intricate details without loosing the track.
